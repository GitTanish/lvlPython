# 🐍 My Python Revision Journey

Welcome to my personal Python revision repository! This space is designed to help me reinforce key concepts, practice coding, and serve as a quick reference guide whenever I need a refresher.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- **📚 Consolidate Knowledge**: Centralize notes, code snippets, and examples from multiple learning resources.
- **📈 Track Progress**: Keep a clear log of what’s been covered and what needs more focus.
- **🧠 Quick Reference**: Create a go-to hub for Python syntax, libraries, and common coding patterns.
- **💪 Practice & Mastery**: Tackle exercises and mini challenges to deepen understanding.
